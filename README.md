# sixdegrees

```sixdegrees``` is a simple program designed by me which demonstrates the agglomeration of my favorite algorithms and data structures.<br>
The entire program is written in C language.<br>

## How to run:

To generate the program, open the Linux terminal, and run the Makefile to compile the C codes by typing ```make```, which creates an executable file **sixdegrees**.<br>

To run the program after the compilation, type:
```
./sixdegrees INPUT.txt OUTPUT.txt
```
on the Linux terminal.<br>

The example of the input file is in the repository.<br>
The results after running the program will be printed in the output file.<br>
